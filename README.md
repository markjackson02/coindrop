# Coindrop 💰

Your webpage for accepting payments & donations. Open-source, zero-fee, and free forever.

Get started at [coindrop.to](https://coindrop.to).

## Problem ❓

Senders and receivers of money must agree on a medium of exchange. With so many apps, currencies, and digital assets available to perform this service, it is not trivial to find the best payment method to use.

Often, receivers will request a specific form of payment, but the potential sender does not have access to this form of payment, or it is not convenient for them. This causes unnecessary friction and potential abandonment of the transaction.

## Solution ✔️

Receivers create a Coindrop page e.g. [coindrop\.to/satoshi-nakamoto](https://coindrop.to/satoshi-nakamoto) and list all their accepted forms of payment. Then receivers use their Coindrop link, button, or QR code anywhere they want to accept payments. The sender simply chooses which payment method to use according to their preference (typically to maximize convenience and minimize transaction fees).

### When/where to use it? 🕒

* Want to accept donations on the internet? ✔️ Post your Coindrop link on your social media profile, or embed a Coindrop button on your website:
