Tipping is backwards for carry-out and delivery orders.

For dine in, we always tip __after__ the meal. This makes sense because all services have been rendered by that time. But for carry-out and delivery orders, we are forced to tip __before__ the meal (after the food is received but before it is consumed).

This is fast because the customer only pays once, __but it doesn't make sense.__

What if the food exceeds your expectations? Sorry, there is no easy way to tip because you already paid.

What if there is a mishap with your order that is undiscovered until during the meal? Sorry, you've already given your possibly undeserved tip.

__There is a simple solution:__ give customers a way to tip after the meal.

[Coindrop](https://coindrop.to/for/restaurants) makes this easy.

Create a Coindrop page (it is 100% free) and list the payment methods your restaurant accepts for tips (PayPal, Bitcoin, etc). Then, include a [Tip Card](https://coindrop.to/shop) in your to-go boxes that links to your Coindrop page. Customers can then send a tip using their payment method of choice in a matter of seconds.

Happy tipping!
