### Fees

This is the area where Coindrop really shines. Coindrop has **zero fees** while Buy Me A Coffee charges **5%** on every transaction.

Coindrop encourages users to list a variety of payment methods. This ensures donors can choose one with a low transaction fee.

Many apps these days charge no fees if it's user-to-user and not a business transaction. PayPal, Venmo, CashApp, and Zelle are all on that list. There are also cryptocurrencies that provide very low transaction fees e.g. Bitcoin Cash.
