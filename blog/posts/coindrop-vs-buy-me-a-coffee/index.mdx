### TL;DR

Coindrop is great if you want to accept zero-fee one-time donations, don't have a need for paywalled content, or want to manage many donation pages under one account.

Buy Me A Coffee is better if you want to accept recurring donations, publish members-only content, or sell products on your donation page. Note there is a 5% transaction fee on all donations.

Keep in mind these platforms are not mutually exclusive. If you want to take advantage of the features of both, you can display both Coindrop and Buy Me A Coffee as options to your potential donors.

### Sharing options

Both Coindrop and Buy Me A Coffee provide users:
- A pretty URL for your page e.g. coindrop.to/markjackson or buymeacoffee.com/markjackson
- An embeddable button for your website

Coindrop additionally provides the donation page's QR Code which can be saved or printed, allowing donors to scan it with their smartphone camera. Most smartphone cameras automatically detect QR codes and will navigate to the donation page.

Winner: Tie ü§∑

### Fees

This is the area where Coindrop really shines. Coindrop has **zero fees** while Buy Me A Coffee charges **5%** on every transaction.

Coindrop encourages users to list a variety of payment methods. This ensures the donor can select one with a low transaction fee.

Many apps these days charge no fees if it's user-to-user and not a business transaction. PayPal, Venmo, CashApp, and Zelle are all on that list. There are also some cryptocurrencies that focus on providing very low transaction fees e.g. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.
