# Terms of Service

By using this software, you are agreeing to the following terms.

## No name squatting Coindrop addresses

Name squatting means taking namespace with no intention of keeping it and using it for a practical purpose. For example, creating coindrop.to/MichaelJackson if that is not your name, or creating https://coindrop.to/CocaCola if you do not have permission from the Coca Cola Company.

Name squatting is not permitted. If a potential violation is detected, Coindrop will contact you via e-mail with details. Please respond promptly with any identification or other requested information to confirm your right to own that Coindrop address. Coindrop reserves the right to remove the Coindrop address from your account ownership if you fail to provide this information or it is deemed inadequate.

## User generated content

Coindrop is only to be used by users to:
1) Identify themselves or a party/organization they represent (name, website)
2) Provide payment information
3) Customize user interface e.g. page themes and preferences

Submission of any other information is not permitted and may result in suspension of your account or page.

## Public information

By using this service, you acknowledge that any information entered on a Coindrop page is public information.
